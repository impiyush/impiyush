I am an extraverted, curious, thorough and highly organized individual with experience in data science, building machine learning models, and deploying end-to-end machine learning applications. I am currently working as an AI/ML consultant.

After spending some time at a few well known global Universities and Companies, where I gained theoretical and practical experience in both machine learning and software development, I am familiar with building quality models while writing clean, concise and readable code. My experience with both machine learning and software engineering, gives me an advantage of being a well rounded machine learning engineer.

I have completed various online courses including the Deep Learning Specialization from deeplearning&#46;ai and Machine Learning Nanodegree from Udacity.

I have a Masters in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. In my leisure time, you can find me hiking, camping, reading, running or playing ping pong.
