# About Me
#### Machine Learning | Data Science | Blogger | NLP | CV 👨‍💻

I am an extraverted, curious, thorough, and highly organized individual with experience in data science, building machine learning models, and deploying end-to-end machine learning applications. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Architect.

After spending time at a few well-known global Universities and Companies, where I gained theoretical and practical experience in both machine learning and software development, I am familiar with building quality models while writing clean, concise, and readable code. My experience with both machine learning and software engineering gives me the advantage of being a well-rounded Machine Learning Engineer.

I have a Masters in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. In my leisure time, you can find me hiking, camping, reading, running, or playing ping pong.
