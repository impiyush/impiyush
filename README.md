#### Machine Learning | Generative AI | Leadership | Blogger | NLP | CV 👨‍💻
---

I am an extraverted, curious, thorough, and highly organized individual with experience in data science, building machine learning models, and deploying end-to-end machine learning pipelines. I have over a decade of experience working in the field of AI/ML and I am currently working as a Sr. Machine Learning Engineer at NIKE.

After spending time at a few well-known global Universities and Organizations, where I gained theoretical and practical experience in both machine learning and software development, I am familiar with building quality models while writing clean, concise, and readable code. My experience with both machine learning and software engineering gives me the advantage of being a well-rounded Machine Learning Engineer.

I have a Masters in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

In my leisure time, you can find me hiking, camping, reading, running, or playing golf.
